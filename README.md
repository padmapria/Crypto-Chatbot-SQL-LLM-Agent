# Crypto-Chatbot-SQL-LLM-Agent
### Ask, analyze, and act on real-time cryptocurrency data ðŸ’°
A conversational AI agent that interacts with a SQL database to provide information on cryptocurrencies.

##  Overview
This project uses LLMs, SQL databases, LangGraph, and Streamlit to build a chat interface for querying cryptocurrency data. LangGraph orchestrates the interaction between these components, managing the flow of information and handling fallback mechanisms to ensure robust query processing. The application is deployed in Docker..

## Features
- Interact with a SQL database using natural language queries
- Retrieve cryptocurrency data (e.g., prices, trends)
- Supports multiple cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Supports general knowledge queries with LLM
- Built using LLMs for accurate and informative responses
- Streamlit-based UI for easy user interaction
  
## Technologies Used
- Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI)
- SQL databases (MySQL)
- Streamlit for UI
- Python 3.x
- Framework used : Langchain, LangGraph

## Orchestration and Fallback Mechanisms
LangGraph is used to orchestrate the interaction between the LLM, SQL database, and Streamlit UI. The graph defines the flow of information and handles fallback mechanisms to ensure robust query processing.
The graph consists of the following nodes:
- Agent: Handles user input and determines the query type (e.g., cryptocurrency data, general knowledge).
- RAG: Retrieves answers from the SQL database using the query generated by the Agent.
- LLM: Generates responses to user queries using the retrieved data from the RAG node.
- Fallback: Handles cases where the RAG node fails to retrieve data or the LLM node fails to generate a response.<br/>

#### The graph is designed to handle the following scenarios:
- Successful query: The Agent generates a query, the RAG node retrieves data from the SQL database, and the LLM node generates a response.
- RAG failure: The RAG node fails to retrieve data, and the Fallback node is triggered to provide a default response.
- LLM failure: The LLM node fails to generate a response, and the Fallback node is triggered to provide a default response.

### Here are the advantages of using the LLM SQL Agent application:

#### User Benefits
- Easy access to cryptocurrency data
- Natural language querying for non-technical users
- Fast and accurate responses
- Interactive chat interface for improved user experience
- Supports multiple cryptocurrencies
- Handles general knowledge queries through fallback mechanism

#### Business Benefits
- Enhanced decision-making with data-driven insights
- Improved operational efficiency through automation
- Reduced manual data analysis and querying time
- Scalable solution for growing cryptocurrency datasets
- Integration with existing SQL databases

####  Technical Benefits
- Leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for accurate responses
- Utilizes SQL databases for structured data storage
- Streamlit-based UI for easy deployment and maintenance
- Modular architecture for easy extension and customization
- Compatible with various cryptocurrency data sources
- Orchestrated workflow using LangGraph for seamless interaction between LLM, SQL database, and UI
- Robust fallback mechanisms to handle errors and exceptions, ensuring minimal downtime and improved user experien

#### Analytical Benefits
- Real-time data analysis and visualization
- Identifies trends and patterns in cryptocurrency markets
- Provides actionable insights for investment decisions
- Supports historical data analysis for predictive modeling
- Enables data-driven strategy development

#### Educational Benefits
- Interactive learning tool for cryptocurrency and data analysis
- Demonstrates applications of LLMs and SQL databases
- Develops critical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Enhances data literacy and interpretation abilities
- Supports academic research and projects

#### Orchestration and Fallback Benefits
- LangGraph's orchestrated workflow ensures efficient and seamless interaction between components
- Robust fallback mechanisms handle errors and exceptions, minimizing downtime and improving user experience
- Fallback mechanisms provide default responses or alternative solutions, ensuring users receive helpful information even in case of errors
- Generic LLM in fallback can handle general knowledge queries, providing users with a more comprehensive and informative experience

By using the LLM SQL Agent application, users can unlock these benefits and improve their cryptocurrency data analysis and decision-making processes.

<h2> How to run our LLM SQL Agent</h2>

<b>OpenAI</b><br/>
- OpenAI provides the API for accessing powerful language models like GPT-3.5 Turbo.<br/>
- In this application, the OpenAI API is used to generate responses based on the data retrieved from Elasticsearch, for the query passed from the chatbot.<br/>

**Note:** OpenAI immediately revokes the API key once it detects that the key has been exposed publicly. Therefore, do not expose your API key.<br/>
<br/>
Generate your OpenAI API key here: [Click Here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

1. Clone this git repository from command prompt<br/>
git clone https://github.com/padmapria/Crypto-Chatbot-SQL-LLM-Agent.git    
cd Crypto-Chatbot-SQL-LLM-Agent    

2. Create a `.env` file inside both the 'app' folder and the notebooks folder and store the key as follows:     
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE<br/>

. Refer to the key in `rag.py` by:  
```python   
from dotenv import load_dotenv   
load_dotenv()   
openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")    
```
3. The application can be tested via jupyter notebook or via streamlit UI deployed via docker.

## Deploy via docker 
1. Install Docker Desktop on your computer and start Docker Desktop    

2. Start the application by running the command from the command prompt <br/>
docker compose up -d

3. Access the deployed application from the brower..        
http://localhost:8501

## Test the application via UI
- Upload a CSV file containing cryptocurrency data
- Enter natural language queries in the chat interface
- Receive informative responses from the LLM SQL agent
